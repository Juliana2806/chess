rem ----
rem Technical remarks:
rem current solution is based on simple Maven and other bat-file usage
rem Other technical possibilities to implement the job is
rem a) call java directly from the bat file:
rem        * need to form correct classpath or duplicate it with maven's
rem b) call mvn exec:java
rem        * here I didn't find a way to make winboard use the mvn's console

set INITIAL_DIRECTORY=%cd%

rem based on fact we're in src/main/bat and need to go to pom.xml location
cd ..\..\..
rem need to use call, otherwise maven takes the control over the batch
call %M3_HOME%bin\mvn package -DskipTests=true

rem another option would be cd src/main/bat
cd %INITIAL_DIRECTORY%
call runEngine.bat
